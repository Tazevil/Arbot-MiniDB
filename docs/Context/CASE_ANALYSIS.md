## Timeline of Bad Communication & Attitude

### Phase 1: Initial Delays (January - April 2025)

| Date | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Jan 24, 2025 | GEOP takes over case | GEOP Assistance | - |
| Feb 18, 2025 | Documents requested | GEOP/Pagez | Repeated requests for already-signed docs |
| Mar 17, 2025 | Document confusion | GEOP/Pagez | Claims docs not received despite DocuSign confirmation |
| Apr 22, 2025 | Last contact before silence | Mustafa Dogan | Sends product specs, then disappears |

**Key Issue:** GEOP coordinator Christian Pagez repeatedly asks for documents already signed via DocuSign, showing poor internal communication.

---

### Phase 2: The Great Silence (April 22 - June 11, 2025)

| Duration | Event | Responsible | Impact |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **49 DAYS** | **Complete silence** | **Mustafa Dogan** | **Total project blockage** |

**Critical Facts:**
- No response to any communication for **7 consecutive weeks**
- Client left without updates on €4,831.84 project
- No explanation provided for silence
- GEOP failed to intervene or replace contractor during this period

**Evidence:** Email logs show zero responses from April 22 to June 11, 2025

---

### Phase 3: Budget Contradictions (June 2025)

| Date | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Jun 17, 2025 08:29 | Contractor announces €450 budget | Mustafa Dogan | Inconsistent with GEOP |
| Jun 17, 2025 13:24 | GEOP announces €600 budget | GEOP/Pagez | €150 difference, no explanation |
| Jun 17, 2025 13:57 | Client asks for clarification | Client | Legitimate question |
| Jun 27, 2025 16:26 | **10-day silence** - Client follows up | Client | No response from GEOP |
| Jul 1, 2025 | GEOP finally responds | GEOP/Pagez | 14-day delay to answer simple question |

**Key Issue:** €150 budget discrepancy, took 14 days to clarify, shows disorganization.

---

### Phase 4: Second Postponement (July 2025)

| Date | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Jul 7, 2025 | Work scheduled for Jul 16 | Mustafa Dogan | Initial commitment |
| Jul 7, 2025 20:02 | Work postponed to Jul 30 | Mustafa Dogan | 2-week delay, short notice |
| Jul 29, 2025 | **Contractor cancels 24h before** | Mustafa Dogan | **Complete failure** |
| Aug 1, 2025 | Client demands written commitment | Client | Frustrated by repeated delays |

**Critical Facts:**
- Second major postponement
- Cancellation **24 hours before** scheduled start
- No compensation or apology
- Led to complete contractor replacement

---

### Phase 5: Supply Chain Failure (August 18, 2025)

**THE BATHTUB INCIDENT** - Most egregious example of bad attitude:

| Time | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Aug 18, 2025 14:54 | **GEOP demands client order bathtub himself** | **GEOP/Rogliardo** | **Unacceptable demand** |
| Aug 18, 2025 16:00 | Client refuses | Client | Rightfully contests responsibility |
| Aug 18-24, 2025 | **Work blocked 6 days** | GEOP/Rogliardo | Client forced to live in unusable bathroom |

**Jean-Pascal Rogliardo's Email (August 18, 2025 14:54):**
> *"Nous avons un problème d'approvisionnement pour la baignoire. Pouvez-vous la commander vous-même sur Amazon? Nous vous rembourserons."*

**Translation:** "We have a supply problem for the bathtub. Can you order it yourself on Amazon? We'll reimburse you."

**Client's Response (August 18, 2025 16:00):**
> *"Je refuse catégoriquement de commander moi-même les fournitures. Ce n'est pas ma responsabilité."*

**Translation:** "I categorically refuse to order the supplies myself. This is not my responsibility."

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Client 100% correct - supply is contractor's responsibility
- ❌ GEOP attempting to shift their obligations to client
- ❌ Shows lack of professionalism and preparedness
- ❌ Caused 6-day delay and unlivable conditions

---

### Phase 6: Premature Closure Attempt (September 3, 2025)

| Date | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Sep 3, 2025 14:56 | **GEOP closes case without inspection** | **GEOP/Lalande** | **Procedural violation** |
| Sep 5, 2025 19:08 | Client contests closure | Client | Lists multiple defects |
| Sep 8, 2025 11:55 | GEOP acknowledges issue | GEOP/Djadi | Reopens complaint process |

**Lena Lalande's Email (September 3, 2025 14:56):**
> *"Nous clôturons votre dossier suite à l'absence de retour de votre part."*

**Translation:** "We're closing your case due to lack of response from you."

**Client's Response (September 5, 2025 19:08):**
Client lists **5 major defects:**
1. Floor tiles misaligned
2. Defective painting with streaks
3. Non-compliant bathtub installation
4. Suspicious gap in BA13 partition
5. Poor silicone joints finish

**Critical Issue:**
- No reception visit (PV de réception) conducted
- Closure attempted without client sign-off
- Multiple defects ignored
- Violates standard construction procedures

---

### Phase 7: Coordination Breakdown (September 11, 2025)

**THE EMAIL STANDOFF** - Perfect example of poor coordination:

| Time | Event | Responsible | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Sep 11, 2025 12:27 | Rhône Bâtiment proposes Sep 22 repair | Rhône Bâtiment/Houssem | No context, no scope |
| Sep 11, 2025 12:47 | Client asks GEOP what's happening | Client | Legitimate confusion |
| Sep 11, 2025 12:53 | Client tells contractor to wait | Client | Wants written plan first |
| Sep 11, 2025 12:59 | **Contractor insists on dates** | Rhône Bâtiment | Ignores client's concern |
| Sep 11, 2025 13:36 | Client explains damage extent | Client | Lists floor, paint issues |
| Sep 11, 2025 13:45 | **"Planning is our business"** | **Rhône Bâtiment** | **Dismissive attitude** |
| Sep 11, 2025 14:20 | Client ends exchange | Client | "I'm the one suffering this situation" |

**Bouharb Houssem's Email (September 11, 2025 13:45):**
> *"Le planning c'est notre affaire. Donnez-nous juste vos disponibilités."*

**Translation:** "Planning is our business. Just give us your availability."

**Client's Final Response (September 11, 2025 14:20):**
> *"C'est moi qui subis cette situation. Le manque d'information n'est pas acceptable."*

**Translation:** "I'm the one suffering this situation. The lack of information is not acceptable."

**Analysis:**
- Contractor dismisses legitimate client concerns
- No technical plan provided
- No scope of repair work defined
- Attitude: "Just do what we say" instead of transparent communication

## Pattern of Bad Attitude

### 1. Deflection of Responsibility

**Examples:**
- GEOP asks client to order bathtub (Aug 18)
- Contractor cancels 24h before start (Jul 29)
- Premature closure attempt (Sep 3)

**Pattern:** When problems arise, blame or burden shifted to client.

---

### 2. Lack of Transparency

**Examples:**
- Budget contradictions (€450 vs €600)
- No explanation for 49-day silence
- No technical plan for repairs
- Vague "retouches" without scope

**Pattern:** Information withheld, client kept in dark about process.

---

### 3. Procedural Violations

**Examples:**
- No reception visit (PV) conducted
- Closure without inspection
- No written action plan provided
- Document requests despite DocuSign confirmation

**Pattern:** Standard procedures ignored or bypassed.

---

### 4. Dismissive Communication

**Examples:**
- "Planning is our business" (Sep 11)
- "Just give your availability" (Sep 11)
- Insistence without explanation
- Pressure for validation without answers

**Pattern:** Client concerns minimized or dismissed.

| **Financial damages** | MODERATE | Need cost calculation | 60% |

---

## Recommended Legal Actions

### 1. Formal Complaint to MAAF (Mandant)

**Objective:** Notify MAAF that their contractor GEOP failed systematically.

**Key Points:**
- GEOP's 49-day failure to manage first contractor
- August 18 bathtub incident (supply chain failure)
- September 3 premature closure attempt
- Multiple construction defects at completion

**Expected Outcome:** MAAF pressure on GEOP, potential compensation

---

### 2. Formal Mise en Demeure to GEOP

**Objective:** Demand immediate corrective action with legal deadline.

**Demands:**
1. Complete technical audit of all defects
2. Written action plan with schedule
3. Professional repair by qualified contractor
4. Compensation for delays (€X per day)
5. Final reception visit with PV

**Deadline:** 15 days to respond, 30 days to complete repairs

---

### 3. Expert Contre-Expertise

**Objective:** Independent assessment of defects and non-compliance.

**Scope:**
- Bathtub installation (structural safety)
- Floor tiles (alignment, stability)
- BA13 partition (insulation, compliance)
- Painting quality
- Overall workmanship

**Cost:** €500-800 (recoverable if case won)

---

### 4. Complaint to Professional Bodies

**Targets:**
- GEOP parent company (Stelliant)
- Insurance regulatory authority
- Consumer protection agency (DGCCRF)

**Objective:** Pressure and precedent for systemic failures

---

## Key Witnesses

| Name | Role | Reliability | Testimony Value |
|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Jérôme Gelin | GEOP expert | LOW | Minimized defects in Sep 15 report |
| Centre d'expertise Lyon 2 | Initial expert | MEDIUM | Provided fair initial assessment |
| Djahid AZRINE | Expert | NEUTRAL | Credible if called |
| MAAF agent | Insurance | NEUTRAL | Can confirm delays |

**Strategy:** Avoid relying on GEOP-affiliated witnesses. Use timeline and documentation as primary evidence.
